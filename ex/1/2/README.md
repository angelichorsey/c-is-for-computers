## Exercise 1-2.
Experiment to find out what happens when `printf`'s argument string contains \\_c_, where _c_ is some character not listed above.

## Output
```
hello, world
plus a bunch of garble
```

## Comments
Found out some neat _c_ choices from trying to find how to print a degree symbol in the next exercises. \\_nnn_ with _n_ being numbers, provides numeric ASCII access...I think.

Also the compiler complains a bunch about the unknown symbols.
